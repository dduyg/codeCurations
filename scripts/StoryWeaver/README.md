## `story_weaver.py`
_This is a Python-based story generator that creates unique short stories based on user-provided themes. It uses Markov Chains for dynamic storytelling and allows users to add custom themes, characters, and plot elements for more personalized narratives._

## How It Works
1. **Run the script** in a Python environment (`story_weaver.py`).
2. Select a **predefined theme** (e.g., cyberpunk, haunted house) or type **"custom"** to create your own.
3. If you choose **custom**, enter your own settings, characters, conflicts, and resolutions.
4. The script generates a *random, unique story* using a mix of predefined elements and Markov Chains.

## Example Output
Input Theme: `"cyberpunk"`

Generated Story:
```
In a neon-lit cityscape, Rogue AI Zeta and Hacker Zero embarked on a dangerous adventure.
They soon faced a rogue AI takeover, which seemed almost impossible to overcome.
With quick thinking and courage, they managed to hack the mainframe.
Their story became a legend, told across the lands.
```

## Customization
Want to create your own *story universe*?🪄

Simply select `"custom"` during theme selection and enter:

- Your **own settings** (e.g., "a floating city")
- **Unique characters** (e.g., "Detective Vega")
- **Conflicts** (e.g., "a mysterious disappearance")
- **Resolutions** (e.g., "finding a secret underground lab")

The script will dynamically integrate these into its storytelling system!
### Happy storytelling! 📖✨
